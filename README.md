# code-coverage-reporter
A code coverage tool made to scan websites and resolve their coverage

Development Road Map:

1. Application resolves how many bytes it takes to load a list of webpages (DONE)
2. Application resolves how many bytes per page are not used (In progress)
3. User can configure what data is shown / e.g. bytes and coverage or bytes alone (TODO)

Usage:

- Include a list of web urls inside the mock.json file

- run `node index.js` to run the node process
