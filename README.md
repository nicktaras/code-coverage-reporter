# code-coverage-reporter
A code coverage tool made to scan websites and resolve their coverage

Development Road Map:

1. Application resolves how many bytes it takes to run a web page
2. Application resolves how many bytes per page are not used
3. User can configure what data is shown / e.g. bytes and coverage or bytes alone
